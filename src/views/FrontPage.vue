            As a dedicated full stack engineer at Commerce Bank, Julio combines technical expertise with a passion for 
            empowering others and continuous self-improvement. With a career spanning two dynamic software companies, Julio 
            has honed their skills in data management+analysis, .NET Development, and team management/project coordination. 
            Julio currently helps build platforms and applications for Commerce Bank’s internal systems.

            Approach was the first software company that Julio worked at and is where the passion for software development 
            was first inspired. Julio coordinated developers’ efforts in bug resolutions from testing to production. He 
            also created an onboarding process and incorporated internal documentation for new hires. Before Approach was 
            acquired by a corporation, Julio played a crucial role in its start up days by helping decide what software 
            tools to use for client management and how. Approach graciously trained him in custom per-business 
            environment creation/maintenance, user management, and multi-platform applications through the use of AWS 
            services(such as Cognito, Lambda, DynamoDB), BitBucket, Google firebase, Expo Go and more.

            Julio proudly serves his community through AmeriCorp’s Lift as You Climb program. Lift as You Climb gathers 
            service members to peer mentor students in participating scholar programs to strengthen their sense of belonging,
            increase their academic abilities, and connect them to any university resource that they may need. Julio is
            also honored to credit his growth in service to the following organizations that allowed him to play a small 
            role in their massive objective of helping their communities through ecological and/or interpersonal efforts: 
            Missouri Stream Team, Wayside Waifs, Heart n Hand, Service Learning, HappyBottoms, and more.

            Julio credits his achievements and best traits to the bottomless well of love and support that has been supplied
            by family, friends, and peers. As the oldest of 5 with younger siblings down to the age of 7, and a knack for 
            connecting with anyone that offers a new perspective, Julio is constantly inspired from his surrounding 
            environment. He enjoys learning new things and can be found reading, writing, and exploring new ideas and
              places in his free time.
